## Drupal 9 Site Setup

Pantheon Search for Drupal 9 starts with an existing Pantheon Drupal 9 site. See our [Drupal 9](/drupal-9) doc or [Drupal 9 upgrade and migration](/guides/drupal-9-migration) guide to get your Drupal 9 site set up.

## Solr 8 Features

Pantheon Search with Solr 8 includes multiple built-in features to make scalable, high-performance search more customizable than ever, including:

- media/rich content type indexing such as PDFs, Word documents 
  - Solr has the ability to store information about document relationships in the index. The stored information can be used for queries and can also return child pages in nested form if the relationship is properly stored in the index.
- multiple language support
  - Use Solrâ€™s stemming and language identification libraries that allows for the searching of multiple languages using separate fields, the same field (separate Solr cores), or the same field and Solr core.
- geospatial search with [Geofield](https://www.drupal.org/project/geofield)
  - Solr supports location data for use in spatial/geospatial searches. Using spatial search, you can index points or other shapes, filter search results by shapes and points.
- Drupal Views integration for building search results pages and custom search forms

## Custom Processors

Search API module processors provide a variety of configuration options for your Pantheon Search results, like boosting results based on dates, taxonomy terms, or specific content types, controlling access to content based on permissions, and adding highlighted excerpts to results. 

See the [Search API module processors documentation](https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/modules/search-api/getting-started/processors) for details.
